## 1️⃣ What is an Operating System?

### 📌 Definition:
An **Operating System (OS)** is a software that acts as an **intermediary between user and hardware**. It manages system resources and provides services to applications.

### 🧠 Key Functions:
- Process Management
- Memory Management
- File System Handling
- Device Management
- Security and Access Control

### 💡 Example:
When you run a code editor, OS loads it into memory, allocates CPU time, and manages input/output with disk and keyboard.

---

## 2️⃣ Processes vs Threads

### 🔹 Process:
- A program in execution
- Has **separate memory space**
- Independent from other processes

### 🔹 Thread:
- A **lightweight process**
- Shares memory with other threads in same process
- Ideal for multitasking

### 🧠 Analogy:
- Process = Chrome Browser
- Threads = Tabs inside Chrome

### 📍 Example:
In a music app:
- One thread plays music
- One thread handles UI
- One thread downloads album art

---

## 3️⃣ CPU Scheduling Algorithms

Scheduling determines which process gets the CPU next.

### 🔸 FCFS (First Come First Serve):
- Like a queue at a bank
- Non-preemptive
- Once a process starts executing, it runs until it completes, even if another process arrives while it's running
- one of the easiest CPU scheduling algorithms to understand and implement

### 🔸 SJF (Shortest Job First):
- Executes the job with shortest burst time
- May cause starvation
- [[Great question! Let's break it down.

> **"May cause starvation"** — in the context of **Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling**, this means:

#### 🧠 Starvation Explained:
If **shorter processes keep arriving**, the **longer processes may never get scheduled**, because the scheduler always picks the shortest job.

#### 🔸 Example:
Let’s say we have one long job `P1` (burst time 20ms), and a bunch of small jobs `P2, P3, P4...` (each 1ms) keep arriving continuously.

- SJF always picks the shortest one first.
- So `P1` keeps waiting... and waiting...
- It **starves** — never gets CPU time.

This is called **starvation**, a form of **indefinite blocking**.]]


### 🔸 Round Robin:
- Each process gets equal time (quantum)
- Preemptive -> scheduler can interrupt a process and switch to another process after the time quantum expires
- each process receives an equal, fixed amount of time (the "quantum") to execute before being preempted and moved to the back of the ready queue.
- This ensures fairness and allows all processes to get a chance to run.

### 🔸 Priority Scheduling:
- Higher priority runs first
- Can be preemptive or non-preemptive

### 📍 Example:
Imagine 3 tasks arriving:
```
P1 (BT=4)   P2 (BT=2)   P3 (BT=1)
```
In FCFS: P1 → P2 → P3

In SJF:  P3 → P2 → P1

## 🧠 **Memory Management in OS**
Memory management is **how the operating system (OS)** handles and organizes the computer’s memory (RAM).  
Think of RAM as your study table. The OS decides **what goes where**, **how much space each item gets**, and **cleans up** when it’s not needed anymore.

---

### 📌 **Main Responsibilities of Memory Management**
1. **Keep Track of Memory Usage**  
   The OS needs to know which parts of RAM are being used and which are free.  
   Example: Like a hotel manager knows which rooms are occupied.

2. **Allocate/Deallocate Memory**  
   When a program starts, the OS gives it memory. When the program ends, the memory is freed.  
   Example: Giving someone a room when they check in, and cleaning it after they leave.



## 🔸 **Paging**
**Paging** breaks memory into **fixed-size blocks** called **pages**.

- **Why?**  
  To avoid **external fragmentation** (i.e., small gaps of unusable memory).

  What it is:
      - External fragmentation occurs when dynamic memory allocation (where memory is allocated and deallocated as needed) leaves small, unusable gaps between allocated blocks. 
   - Even if the total amount of free memory is larger than the process's required size, these gaps prevent contiguous allocation, making it impossible to load the process. 
   - This can lead to a situation where a process cannot be loaded into memory even though there's enough total memory space available. 

## Why it happens:
   - Dynamic memory allocation, where processes are loaded and unloaded as needed, can create these gaps as memory blocks are freed and reallocated.
   - As processes are removed from memory, the remaining free space is fragmented into smaller blocks. 
## Impact:
External fragmentation can significantly reduce the effective memory available, as the scattered free space cannot be used. 
It can prevent large processes from loading, even if there's enough total free memory
  
- **How?**  
  🔹 Memory (RAM) is divided into equal-sized **frames**  
  🔹 Processes are divided into equal-sized **pages**  
  🔹 The OS uses a **page table** to map logical addresses (used by the program) to physical addresses (actual location in RAM).

### 🧾 Example:
Imagine RAM is a bookshelf with fixed-sized slots (frames).  
You have a book (process) split into chapters (pages).  
The OS keeps a **table** to remember which chapter is in which slot.


## 🧠 What is Segmentation?

**Segmentation** is a memory management scheme in which **memory is divided into variable-sized segments**, where **each segment represents a logical unit** of a program:
- Code (instructions)
- Data (global/static variables)
- Stack (function calls, local variables)
- Heap (dynamic memory like `malloc` in C, `new` in Java)

> Instead of dividing memory into equal-sized chunks (like paging), segmentation splits memory based on **logical divisions**.

---

## 📦 How Segmentation Works

### ✨ Key Concepts:

1. **Segment Table** (maintained by OS per process):
   - Stores for each segment:
     - `Base`: Starting physical address of the segment
     - `Limit`: Length/size of the segment
   - Example entry:  
     ```
     Segment  |  Base  |  Limit
     -------------------------
     Code     |  1000  |  400
     Data     |  1400  |  300
     Stack    |  1700  |  200
     Heap     |  1900  |  500
     ```

2. **Logical Address** = `<Segment Number, Offset>`

3. **Physical Address** = `Base of Segment + Offset`

   - The offset **must be less than the segment’s limit**, otherwise: **Segmentation Fault** (error).

---

### 🧮 Example:

Let’s say:
- Segment 1 (Data): Base = 1400, Limit = 300  
- You access: Logical address = ⟨1, 50⟩ →  
  - Physical Address = `1400 + 50 = 1450` ✅

But if: ⟨1, 350⟩ → `1400 + 350 = 1750` ❌  
- This exceeds the `Limit = 300`, so the OS raises a **segmentation fault**.

---

## 🧠 Why Segmentation?

1. **Matches Program Structure**:
   - Programs are already divided into parts: code, data, stack, heap.
   - Helps in protection and isolation (e.g., stack overflow doesn’t affect code).

2. **Supports Sharing and Protection**:
   - You can make code segment **read-only**.
   - Multiple processes can **share** the same code segment.

3. **Supports Dynamic Growing Segments**:
   - Stack grows downward.
   - Heap grows upward.

## 🔧 Segmentation vs Paging

| Feature           | Segmentation                    | Paging                          |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Division          | Logical (code, stack, etc.)     | Fixed-size (pages)              |
| Size              | Variable                        | Fixed                           |
| Address format    | ⟨Segment Number, Offset⟩         | ⟨Page Number, Offset⟩           |
| Fragmentation     | External fragmentation          | Internal fragmentation          |
| Complexity        | More complex (variable sizes)   | Simpler (uniform page size)     |

---

## ⚠️ Drawbacks of Segmentation

1. **External Fragmentation**:
   - Since segments are variable in size, **holes** may be left after freeing memory.
   - It’s harder for OS to find continuous memory for large segments.

2. **Complex Memory Allocation**:
   - Need smart allocation algorithms (Best-Fit, Worst-Fit, etc.).

3. **Slower Access (Compared to Paging)**:
   - Extra step for segment-to-physical address translation.

---

## 🧠 Real-World Analogy:

Think of a program like a **book**:
- Chapters = Segments (Code, Data, Stack, etc.)
- Each chapter is different in length.
- If you try to read past the end of a chapter (offset > limit) → Error!

---

## 🧪 Sample Interview Question:

> **Q:** What happens when you access memory outside the segment limit in segmentation?
>  
> **A:** It raises a **segmentation fault**, because the offset exceeded the segment’s limit. This is a memory access violation handled by the OS.

## ✅ Summary (Easy to Recall)

| Term        | Meaning                             |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| Segment     | Logical unit (code, stack, etc.)     |
| Base        | Start of segment in physical memory  |
| Limit       | Length of the segment                |
| Segment Table | Table of all base/limit entries    |
| External Fragmentation | Waste due to varying sizes |

### 🧠 Difference between Paging and Segmentation:

| Feature        | Paging                      | Segmentation                   |
|----------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Division       | Fixed-size pages             | Variable-size segments          |
| Mapping        | Page table                   | Segment table                   |
| Fragmentation  | Avoids **external**          | Can cause **external**          |
| Flexibility    | Less (uniform blocks)        | More (logical structure)        |



## 📍 **Real-Life Example: Opening Browser Tabs**

Let’s say you open multiple tabs in Chrome:

- Each tab is a **process** or a **thread**.
- OS allocates a **page** for each tab in memory.
- It keeps a **page table** to track which tab’s memory is stored where in RAM.

So, if Tab 1 crashes, it doesn’t affect Tab 2 — because each has its own separate memory block.


---

## 5️⃣ Deadlock

### 📌 What is Deadlock?
A state where **two or more processes are waiting for each other** to release resources.

### 🔸 Four Conditions (Coffman):
1. Mutual Exclusion
2. Hold and Wait
3. No Preemption
4. Circular Wait

### 🔸 Solutions:
- **Avoidance**: e.g., Banker’s algorithm
- **Detection and Recovery**
- **Prevention**: Break at least one Coffman condition

### 🧠 Analogy:
Two people face each other in a narrow hallway, each waiting for the other to move.

---

## 6️⃣ Concurrency & Synchronization

### 🔸 Problem:
When multiple threads/processes access **shared resources**, inconsistency can occur.

### 🔹 Race Condition:
Output depends on **timing/order of execution**

### 🔹 Critical Section:
Portion of code accessing shared resource

### 🔹 Semaphores:
A synchronization tool to manage access to critical section

```c
semaphore S = 1;
wait(S);
   // critical section
signal(S);
```

### 📍 Example:
Two people editing the same Google doc paragraph without coordination = mess.

---

## 7️⃣ File System

### 📌 Role of File System:
- Manages how data is stored and retrieved
- Provides abstraction (filenames vs physical disk sectors)

### 🔸 Concepts:
- **Inode**: Metadata about file (size, location)
- **File Descriptor**: Handle to access file
- **Directory**: Special file that maps names to inodes

### 📍 Example:
Like a book index → points to page number → actual content

---

## 8️⃣ Virtual Memory & Paging

### 🔹 Virtual Memory:
Lets you run programs **larger than actual RAM** using disk as backup

### 🔹 Paging with Virtual Memory:
- Logical address split into **Page Number + Offset**
- Uses **page tables** to translate logical to physical addresses

### 🔹 Page Replacement Algorithms:
- **FIFO**: Oldest page replaced
- **LRU**: Least recently used page replaced
- **Optimal**: Replace page not used for longest time (ideal)

---

## 9️⃣ System Calls & Context Switching

### 🔸 System Call:
Interface to request OS services (e.g., `open()`, `read()`, `write()`)

### 🔸 Context Switch:
When CPU switches from one process to another
- Saves current state (PCB)
- Loads new process’s state

### 📍 Example:
Switching TV channels – saving one show’s state and loading another
