## 1️⃣ What is an Operating System?

### 📌 Definition:
An **Operating System (OS)** is a software that acts as an **intermediary between user and hardware**. It manages system resources and provides services to applications.

### 🧠 Key Functions:
- Process Management
- Memory Management
- File System Handling
- Device Management
- Security and Access Control

### 💡 Example:
When you run a code editor, OS loads it into memory, allocates CPU time, and manages input/output with disk and keyboard.

---

## 2️⃣ Processes vs Threads

### 🔹 Process:
- A program in execution
- Has **separate memory space**
- Independent from other processes

### 🔹 Thread:
- A **lightweight process**
- Shares memory with other threads in same process
- Ideal for multitasking

### 🧠 Analogy:
- Process = Chrome Browser
- Threads = Tabs inside Chrome

### 📍 Example:
In a music app:
- One thread plays music
- One thread handles UI
- One thread downloads album art

---

## 3️⃣ CPU Scheduling Algorithms

Scheduling determines which process gets the CPU next.

### 🔸 FCFS (First Come First Serve):
- Like a queue at a bank
- Non-preemptive

### 🔸 SJF (Shortest Job First):
- Executes the job with shortest burst time
- May cause starvation

### 🔸 Round Robin:
- Each process gets equal time (quantum)
- Preemptive

### 🔸 Priority Scheduling:
- Higher priority runs first
- Can be preemptive or non-preemptive

### 📍 Example:
Imagine 3 tasks arriving:
```
P1 (BT=4)   P2 (BT=2)   P3 (BT=1)
```
In FCFS: P1 → P2 → P3
In SJF:  P3 → P2 → P1

## 4️⃣ Memory Management

### 📌 Responsibilities:
- Keep track of memory usage
- Allocate/deallocate memory

### 🔸 Paging:
- Breaks memory into **fixed-size blocks** (pages)
- Avoids external fragmentation
- Uses **page table** to map logical → physical addresses

### 🔸 Segmentation:
- Breaks memory into **logical units** (code, data, stack)
- More flexible but can cause fragmentation

### 📍 Example:
You open multiple tabs:
- Each gets a page in RAM
- OS maintains a table mapping each tab’s memory

---

## 5️⃣ Deadlock

### 📌 What is Deadlock?
A state where **two or more processes are waiting for each other** to release resources.

### 🔸 Four Conditions (Coffman):
1. Mutual Exclusion
2. Hold and Wait
3. No Preemption
4. Circular Wait

### 🔸 Solutions:
- **Avoidance**: e.g., Banker’s algorithm
- **Detection and Recovery**
- **Prevention**: Break at least one Coffman condition

### 🧠 Analogy:
Two people face each other in a narrow hallway, each waiting for the other to move.

---

## 6️⃣ Concurrency & Synchronization

### 🔸 Problem:
When multiple threads/processes access **shared resources**, inconsistency can occur.

### 🔹 Race Condition:
Output depends on **timing/order of execution**

### 🔹 Critical Section:
Portion of code accessing shared resource

### 🔹 Semaphores:
A synchronization tool to manage access to critical section

```c
semaphore S = 1;
wait(S);
   // critical section
signal(S);
```

### 📍 Example:
Two people editing the same Google doc paragraph without coordination = mess.

---

## 7️⃣ File System

### 📌 Role of File System:
- Manages how data is stored and retrieved
- Provides abstraction (filenames vs physical disk sectors)

### 🔸 Concepts:
- **Inode**: Metadata about file (size, location)
- **File Descriptor**: Handle to access file
- **Directory**: Special file that maps names to inodes

### 📍 Example:
Like a book index → points to page number → actual content

---

## 8️⃣ Virtual Memory & Paging

### 🔹 Virtual Memory:
Lets you run programs **larger than actual RAM** using disk as backup

### 🔹 Paging with Virtual Memory:
- Logical address split into **Page Number + Offset**
- Uses **page tables** to translate logical to physical addresses

### 🔹 Page Replacement Algorithms:
- **FIFO**: Oldest page replaced
- **LRU**: Least recently used page replaced
- **Optimal**: Replace page not used for longest time (ideal)

---

## 9️⃣ System Calls & Context Switching

### 🔸 System Call:
Interface to request OS services (e.g., `open()`, `read()`, `write()`)

### 🔸 Context Switch:
When CPU switches from one process to another
- Saves current state (PCB)
- Loads new process’s state

### 📍 Example:
Switching TV channels – saving one show’s state and loading another
